I gave a talk at [Digital Dragons 2025](https://digitaldragons.pl/en/) on how we tackled the rendering scalability challenges on LEGO Horizon Adventures.

**This will be available on YouTube soon**

## Synopsis
> LEGO® Horizon Adventures™ immerses the player in an entirely brick based world, made from highly reflective and geometrically complex models. In this talk we will cover how we scaled this across all target platforms, whilst achieving critically acclaimed visuals and staying on schedule. We explain the overall methodology, how we extended Unreal significantly, and technical details for GI, reflections, subsurface scattering, anti-aliasing, occlusion and more.
