Working on [Star Wars : Hunters](/portfolio/star-wars-hunters) to bring AAA quality visuals to Android, iOS and Switch (and now PC). Some of my responsibilities included:

* Tight collaboration with art teams to realize their requirements in-engine. 
* A focus on performance; creating isolated test scenarios to identify problem areas and allow for measurable iteration. In-depth analysis of performance data. Description and delegation of specific optimisation tasks for other teams.
* Low level optimisations to improve GPU throughput, synchronization and shader occupancy.
* Automated tooling for capturing all images for the store in editor, with a high degree of customisability, and combatible with all UI layouts due to additional framing logic.
* Iteration on a novel stylized shading model, including light masking, graduated shadows and rim lighting.
* Disk and runtime memory reductions, including compressed cubemaps and shader bytecode.
* Per API accommodations for Vulkan, Metal, DirectX and Switch
* Numerous Unreal modifications, deep dives, and bug fixes. Upgrading of our customized engine to newer versions
* Development of tools for cosmetics assessment & image captures, shader cache creation and asset validation.
* Providing feedback and documentation for junior programmers and new team members. Voicing innovate ideas for the games development and production & asset pipelines
