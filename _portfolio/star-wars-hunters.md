* Automated tooling for capturing all images for the store in editor, with a high degree of customisability, and combatible with all UI layouts due to additional framing logic.

For Lego Horizon Adventures we wanted to take LEGO games to a new level, and achieve movie quality visuals on console hardware. As principal graphics programmer I was involved in many areas of this effort:

* A pipeline for models which produces high quality meshes for all target platforms, whilst allowing extensive customisation of models such as color and finish.
* Improvements to high-end lighting such as improved AO and 
* Improving quality and stability of upscaling solutions
*

These principles were applied to all our target platforms, with alternative techniques developed for less powerful devices. This included accurate reflections, global illumination, cinematic depth of field, high-fidelity shadows and post processing. All of this comes together to provide our players a memorable and visually engaging experience, whatever they play on. I was also managing the collaboration with external programming teams on this work.
